## Task 1: permutation.py 
a function that takes in an array of unique integers and returns an array of all permutations of those integers in no particular order.
If the input array is empty, the function should return an empty array.
array = [1, 2, 3]
Sample output = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]
## Task 2: Deep Learning CNN:
Perform image classification using RESNET-50 architecture on STL-10 dataset.
## Task 3: Deep Learning - YOLO:
Fine tune a Yolov8 model using Yolo nano model as a base and train MS COCO car damage detection dataset on 2 epochs and apply the trained model to infer on the provided video.
